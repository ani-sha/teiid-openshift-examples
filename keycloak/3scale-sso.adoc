= Securing With OData API through 3scale and Keycloak 

This example is continuation of "rdbms-example", so if you have not gone through that project yet, the tasks in there should be completed first before going through this example.

The main aim in this example is to secure the Data Virtualization's OData API interface using the 3scale and Keycloak. We will use OpenID-Connect as authentication mechanism to secure the API and use OAuth2 as authorization mechanism. 

Note that in this example, the installation of Keycloak is done using a template file from Keycloak, however if you already have Keycloak environment set up in OpenShift then we suggest you use that instance. We only showing this step here for illustration purposes only.

== [[3scale based API Management]]3scale based API Management

Using 3scale one can manage/monetize on APIs that are available for consumption. Here in this example, the OData API is being managed through 3scale, however the API is secured through Keycloak/RH-SSO. When the user logs in, 3scale will engage in authentication with Keycloak, upon success it will then delegate the security token down to the OData API. OData API will verify the token, and read permissions from token and apply those to the data roles defined on the virtual database. The below diagram illustrates authentication flow.

== Configure 3scale with Keycloak

Here is link:https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/11/21/setup-3scale-openid-connect-oidc-integration-rh-sso/[excellent article] written on this subject here rather than duplicate the information follow this one to install the Keycloak and configure it for 3scale use.

In the above article, go through until Keycloak security realms, and users, roles are created, just short of configuration in the 3scale. You only need to do this very fist time. Then go to next section to configure the Data Virtualization service, once that service is discovered in 3scale, follow through rest of the article.

== [[Configure Data Virtualization with 3scale and Keycloak]]Configure Data Virtualization with 3scale and Keycloak

So far we have setup the Keycloak server in OpenShift and configured it for to be used with Data Virtualization. But before we can use KeyCloak based security on OData API, the example needs to be modified to make use of the Keycloak. For it make the below code changes.

==== pom.xml
The `pom.xml` needs to be added with additional dependencies for Keycloak, as described below

in the "dependencies" section add

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.teiid</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-keycloak-odata</artifactId>
</dependency> 
----

this should replace previous dependency

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.teiid</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-odata</artifactId>
</dependency> 
----

==== application.properties

The `src/main/resources/application.properties` needs to be added with following additional properties

----
keycloak.realm = 3scale-sso
keycloak.auth-server-url = http://keycloak-staging.dev.openshiftapps.com/auth
keycloak.resource = 3scale-admin
keycloak.ssl-required = external
keycloak.public-client = false
keycloak.credentials.secret=4078a69a-9da9-45b8-84d9-5f1171a19aba
keycloak.principal-attribute=preferred_usernamekeycloak.credentials.secret
----

Note that depending on your environment, the above properties may have different values, especially from environment to environment and how you setup your Keycloak server.

Note that you can find all the the values for above properties in keycloak's administrative console.


==== deploymentconfig.yml

The `src/main/fabric8/deploymentconfig.yml` needs to be added with ENVIRONMENT variables that may be different in different deployments. If you are deploying application in DEV and PROD environments, you need a mechanism to switch the configuration to match that environment without changing the application code.

Most of the properties can be static in nature, but the Auth URL and credentials might change from environment to environment. We can configure this property into a Configmap and access its value from there. To add the property `keycloak.auth-server-url` and `keycloak.credentials.secret` do following to create a ConfigMap

----
oc create configmap my-config --from-literal=keycloak.auth-server-url=http://keycloak-staging.dev.openshiftapps.com/auth --from-literal=keycloak.credentials.secret=4078a69a-9da9-45b8-84d9-5f1171a19aba
----

Above creates a config map called `my-config` in OpenShift, that can be referenced from your deployment config as shown below. Between DEV and PROD make sure the name of the config map name stays same but the contents will vary. Note there are many ways to create config maps, the above is a simple example.

Then in the `src/main/fabric8/deploymentconfig.yml` add

----
- name: KEYCLOAK_AUTHSERVERURL
  valueFrom:
     configMapKeyRef:
       name: <config-name>
       key: keycloak.auth-server-url
- name: KEYCLOAK_CREDENTIALS_SECRET
  valueFrom:
     configMapKeyRef:
       name: <config-name>
       key: keycloak.credentials.secret
       
----

where <config-name> in above code fragment is "my-config" in this example. Note that if you used different realm or client by the environment you would have to adjust all those properties using the deploymentconfig.yml file using same technique of externalizing the properties from the application code.

==== customer-vdb.ddl

The previous example's virtual database does not define any Data Roles. Add these following two lines to the .DDL file at `src/main/resources/customer-vdb.ddl`

----
CREATE ROLE ReadRole WITH JAAS ROLE ReadRole;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "portfolio.CustomerZip" TO ReadRole
----

In the above, the first line is creating role called "ReadRole" and mapping to the role we created earlier in Keycloak's role with same name of "ReadRole". They can be different, but here for simplicity the same name is used. The second line gives the SELECT permissions to the `portfolio.CustomerZip` View to the user with "ReadRole" grant.

== Build Example

Execute following command to build and deploy a custom Teiid image to the OpenShift.

----
$ mvn clean install -Popenshift -Dfabric8.namespace=`oc project -q`
----

==  Testing

Now using the browser you can issue an OData API call such as

----
http://keycloak-rdbms-example-odata-teiid-dataservice.192.168.99.100.nip.io/CustomerZip
----

You will presented with a login page, where you use the user credentials you created in previous steps and access the service. If you use `user` as user name when you login you will be granted to view the data of the customer view. If you used `developer` as the user name the permission to view the customer data is not granted, as the `developer` user does not have the `ReadRole` role. 

Note that urls like `/$metadata` are specifically excluded from security such that they can be discovered by other services.
